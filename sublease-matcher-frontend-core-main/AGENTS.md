# Repository Guidelines

## Purpose  
This document defines how AI coding agents (e.g., Codex) should operate within the frontend portion of this codebase. It provides guidance on structure, conventions, and workflows so generated code aligns with team standards.

## 1. Project Context  
### Tech Stack  
- Framework: **Next.js** (App Router)  
- Language: **TypeScript** (`.ts` / `.tsx`), strict mode enabled  
- Styling: **Tailwind CSS**, UI components under `components/ui`  
- Path alias: `@/*` refers to `src/*`

### Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/app` holds Next.js App Router routes (home, auth, role selection, lister tools). Treat folders as route segments and colocate page-level loaders/components inside each segment.
- `src/components/ui` centralizes reusable presentation components; prefer adding new shared UI here with matching Storybook-style examples under `examples` when needed.
- `src/lib` is reserved for cross-cutting utilities (API helpers, auth adapters). Keep configuration under project root (`next.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.js`) and static assets in `public/`.

### Standard Commands  
- `npm run dev` → start development server (`http://localhost:3000`)  
- `npm run build` → produce production build  
- `npm run start` → serve production build locally  
- `npm run lint` → run ESLint (Next.js preset); must be clean before PR

## 2. Coding Conventions  
- React functional components only; no class components.  
- File naming: Components = **PascalCase** (`MyWidget.tsx`); functions/vars = **camelCase**; route folders = **kebab-case**.  
- Avoid using `any`. Always type props, state, return types.  
- Tailwind utility classes preferred; component-specific styles go in `src/styles`.  
- Shared UI components go under `src/components/ui`. New shared components should include corresponding example/story under `examples/`.  
- Imports should use `@/*` alias for paths within `src`.

## 3. Agent Workflow Guidelines  
When assigning tasks to an AI coding agent:  
- **Do not repeat** global setup (e.g., Next.js version, tooling) — this file communicates that once.  
- **Focus** the prompt on the new feature/fix: path(s) to edit, UI/UX spec, data contracts, acceptance criteria, and edge cases.  
- **Provide context**: existing types, sample payloads, relevant UI tokens, wireframes/screenshots.  
- **Define deliverables**: file(s) to create or patch, test/validation steps, and merge readiness criteria.

## 4. PR & Commit Rules  
- Commit messages: imperative mood (e.g., “Add search bar component”). Keep subject under 72 characters.  
- PR description must include: goal, user-facing impact summary, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, verification steps (commands run, lint/tests).  
- Code generated by agent must pass lint (`npm run lint`) 

## 5. Security & Configuration  
- `.env.local` holds sensitive secrets (`AUTH_SECRET`, `SAAS_AUTH_SECRET`, etc.).  
- Secrets must **not** be committed. If exposed, rotate immediately.  
- Agents should **not** inject secrets or assume secret values. Use placeholders if necessary (`TODO: insert secret`). 

## 6. Module/Route Specific Overrides (optional)  
If a particular module or folder needs custom agent instructions, consider adding an `AGENTS.md` inside that folder with its specific rules. These override the root-level rules for that scope.
